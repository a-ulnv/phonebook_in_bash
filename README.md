# phonebook_in_bash
Implementation of a phonebook that can store, view, modify and delete contacts in a file using BASH

## Running locally
Ensure that the phonebook storage file exits (it's ok if it is empty) in the same directory with the script. Open project directory in Terminal and run command: ./program.sh

## Expected output
The program will ask your name, and will ask to type in the name of phonebook storage file. When logged into the system, you can use letters to navigate between phonebook functions. The program is expected to successfully create, store, edit, delete and display contacts.

## TODO
- Implement phonebook storage file autocreation, if it doesn't exist.
